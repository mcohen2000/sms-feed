# SMS Feed

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project designed to empower individuals and businesses to set up and manage SMS-based services. This application would greatly benefit people looking to deliver news letters, marketing updates, and notifications. The service is controlled from a dashboard where admins can create and manage posts, which can later be sent or scheduled for delivery at a future time. Admins can also review analytics like monthly subscribers, total subscribers, and total messages sent.
